# fastgeoref

This package contains tools for extracting training data, building detection models, object tracking, and geo-referencing animals (e.g. dolphins) from drone videos as described in [1]. The core advancement that this work offers in studying wild-animal behaviour non-invasively is by providing a fast and efficient algorithm that can geo-reference object positions such that animal tracks can be ontained and analysed using traditional track-analysis methods. The package combines video processing, manual/automatic animal tracking, and drone flight log integration for studying animal behaviour in the wild. For a case study that uses scripts in this package see [2].

## Installation

Clone this repository and install locally:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dolphintracker.git
cd fastgeoref
pip install -e .

## Features

- **`datagen`** – Extract training images (animal/background) from videos by interactively clicking frames.
- **`modelbuild`** – Build and train object detection models.
- **`objtrackauto`** – Automatically detect and track objects in drone video.
- **`georef`** – Convert raw pixel-level tracks into geo-referenced coordinates using drone log files.
- **`objtrackmanual`** – Manually click on animals in video and geo-reference their tracks.

All the above functions can be implemented through a simple GUI, without the need to dwelve into specific files.
